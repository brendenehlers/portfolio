# Portfolio

Welcome to the repo for my "portfolio" website. That's in quotes because I don't yet have any projects or anything else listed. I made the cool design you see on the home page and I couldn't match it with the rest of the website, so I removed the rest of the website.

This website is built entirely with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS. Everything to do with npm and node is used for configuration... Someone needs to figure out the configuration situation.
